"""
Automated Qualtrics Survey Building
===================================

**qualtrics.py** is a simple Python library for scripting the creation of
Qualtrics surveys. It provides convenient wrapper methods for accessing the
Qualtrics survey-definitions REST API, along with a convenient object-oriented
interface for building virtual surveys to load through that API.

See README for a more detailed overview.
